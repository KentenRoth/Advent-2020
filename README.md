# Advent-2020

Day 1 - I felt very good about.  I sat down and did not take a whole lot of time trying to understand how to do the task
also I felt comfortable when working on the structure.  I know there has to be ways to refactor this to make it cleaner
but I am not sure how to make that happen.

Day 2 - I had a few more issues today.  The first issue was figuring out how to get the data from the txt file I created
I spent some time on google getting that question answered.  After that I had to brush up on how to use split, because
I had run into a few issues with getting the strings split where I wanted.  Once I got split under control everything
else went rather smooth.
